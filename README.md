### Counting Squirrel

- The Counting Squirrel project demonstrates how to extract and analyze data from a CSV file. It reads squirrel census data from Central Park and counts the number of squirrels for each fur color. The result is stored in a new CSV file containing the counts of squirrels based on their fur color.

### Features:

- Data Extraction: Reads data from an existing CSV file that contains squirrel census data.
- Data Analysis: Counts the number of squirrels for each fur color (Gray, Cinnamon, Black).
- Output: Generates a new CSV file containing the fur color and their respective counts.
